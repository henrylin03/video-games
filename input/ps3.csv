If you’re not careful, it’s very easy for the hunter to become the hunted.

With 15 different dinosaurs across 5 distinct environments including pine forests, muddy marshes and rolling hills, how you approach your target is important.  Wind direction, scent and the use of a special dinosaur call are all key elements in tracking your prey. 

Game Features:
• 3D dinosaurs, from the Herbivorous (plant eating) for novice hunters to the Carnivorous (meat-eating) for experts;
• Choose from among six different weapon types – from a sniper rifle to an X-bow;
• Utilize the map and radar feature to locate and track dinosaurs;
• 2 exciting game modes:
- Hunting: a non-linear hunting experience where players roam through vast landscapes, tracking and hunting a variety of dinosaurs;
- Survival: a timed, frenzied affair where dinosaurs begin rushing the player in an attempt to eat him.  The pace starts slowly and builds, and the person who can stay alive the longest is the winner;
• Online leader boards and social networking integration;
• Interactive Dino Trophy Room.

Coming with updates:
- Ability to jump
- Blood
- Ammo supply
- Statistics and more...

Each circle showcases its own distinct look, with demons, monsters, damned and geography that are crafted straight from the poem's vivid descriptions. To take down the demons of Hell, Dante is outfitted with two primary weapons: the Scythe he takes from Death and the Holy Cross given to him by Beatrice, which has spiritual powers that will help Dante collect souls and spells from the creatures he defeats on his journey. The game also features a deep upgrade system so gamers can customize their abilities to their specific gameplay style, something they'll need as Dante comes face to face with Hell's fiercest beasts and bosses. If successful, Dante will be able to tame certain beasts, exacting their will and turning Hell’s punishments back on itself. [Electronic Arts]",75,7.7

Fracture,PlayStation 3,"October 7, 2008","Amidst a backdrop of worldwide ecological and seismological chaos in the mid-2100s, the United States has been split in two by the ""Great Flood"". As a result of the polar ice cap melting, the Mississippi River has destroyed the central portion of the United States, causing an ill-equipped Federal Government to fail and literally cutting the country in half. These two halves are left to fend for themselves in the aftermath. The East, now known as the Atlantic Alliance, symbolic of their union with Europe, puts its faith in surviving this new world in cybernetics, an established yet evolving technology now more than 150 years old. On the other side of the flooded continent, the Western states, now called the Republic of Pacifica and having allied with Asia, resort to solving their problems at the genetic level, effectively restructuring the DNA of its inhabitants -- a method the Atlantic Alliance finds morally reprehensible. By 2161, it only takes a hint of unauthorized military preparation in Pacifica for the newly restored president to order a strike in the heart of Pacifican territory -- an outpost in the now dry San Francisco Bay. This strike leads to the unthinkable: an epic conflict with global implications fought on U.S. soil. As a soldier in this struggle, Mason Briggs uses explosive, terrain-deforming weaponry to change the face of battle: He not only destroys the land in his path, he outright transforms it to gain the strategic advantage in completely unscripted ways no game has ever seen. With such a devastating arsenal at hand, Briggs never leaves any battlefield the way he found it. In addition to weaponry that allows players to do things previously only imagined, each side of the conflict, Pacifica and the Atlantic Alliance, boast soldiers with powers beyond those of ordinary men. Genetic augmentations provide Pacifican forces with amazing abilities, while Atlantic Alliance soldiers like Briggs counter the threat with the more ""traditional"" method: cybernetics. The differing states of superhumanity result in balanced yet stylistically different combat tactics that have never been seen before. [LucasArts]",62,6.0

In the Groove,PlayStation 2,"June 8, 2005","Get your groove on with the home version of the next generation arcade dance game. In The Groove was designed from the ground up by hardcore dance game fans and represents an incredible leap forward in the genre. While maintaining the same addictive game play of popular dance titles, In The Groove features exclusive, never before seen features like modifiers that make the game arrows spin, change speeds, and boomerang, and move in 3D along with over 60 other amazing effects that create additional challenges and endless customization for dance game fans. Over 70 brand new songs from proven talent and new independent artists, covering a wide variety of genres. Over 550 new step patterns from step artists in the dance community. Unlockable songs and courses. 3 Styles of play: One Player, Two Player, or Double Pad. Up to 5 difficulty levels per song to accommodate all players from beginners to experts. Fast menu navigation and 2 minute songs- spend more time playing. Innovations in step choreography- mines, hands, and quads will have you making new kinds of moves. [RedOctane]",72,8.5
In the Groove 2,PlayStation 2,"June 17, 2005","While Red OctaneÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½s IN THE GROOVE will remind players of KonamiÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½s DANCE DANCE REVOLUTION, the game kicks up the difficulty a notch in several ways, the most prominent of which is requiring three or four arrows to be hit at once. This means players will have to not only jump around but drop to the floor to slap arrows with their hands. Another major difference between IN THE GROOVE and DDR is the arrows. Here, they are fully polygonal, meaning the arrows can spin around, bounce up and down, look like theyÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½re vanishing into the background, and other tricks that challenge the player. Another addition is the mine arrow. Stepping or slapping one of these will cause the arrow to explode and break the combo chain the player was building up. Fortunately, the game includes a large variety of difficulty settings (13 different difficulty levels in all), so even beginners can get into the dancing action. The game play modes include all of the standard ones gamers have come to expect in a dancing game: arcade mode, two-player challenge mode, workout mode, and never-ending modes are all available for players to enjoy. The song list is fairly large as well with over 70 titles. For dance fans that have mastered everything on the market, IN THE GROOVE kicks up the difficulty and will make gamers rethink their entire approach to dancing games as they learn to use their hands and feet together.",tbd,tbd

As the prince, a player's duty is to clean up the King's mess and re-create the starry skies by rolling around the cleverly designed locations to collect objects and build up their 'katamari' -- a Japanese word for clump or large mass. The catch is that it's not the quality or the actual number of objects gathered that is most critical to the player's success, but instead the sheer size of the player's 'katamari' that is most important. Along the way, players can roll over hundreds of unusual objects of all sizes and shapes including cookies, cars, mermaids, planes, clouds and even people. The larger the player's 'katamari' grows, the more objects the player can amass along the way -- thus proving if you want to succeed in Katamari Damacy -- size does matter.

Krysae Sniper Rifle
This Turian antimaterial rifle is modified to kill Reaper enemies.

PAIN: Sore Spots,PlayStation 3,"May 14, 2009",[Playstation Network]  PAINalympics is my favorite new mode. I had a fight with our Vice President over our Relay event. He wanted me to change some things (not all of them I agreed with) and the conversation ended with me having to make other alterations to the mode to make it more fun. While sometimes Mr. Rohde is not my favorite BOSS he often has some valid points. PAINalympics is a much better mode because he decided to needle us until we got it right. Bull ride is a million times better since Rohde gave it his Caesar-esque thumbs down on the first iteration. The reason we decided to do a new add-on like Sore Spots is because you guys were up in arms about the lack of variety in the environments. Sometimes people don’t realize how much work goes into making one environment that does every mode. So instead we thought lets do two smaller ones and satisfy everyone’s need for variety. I think the new environments turned out rather well. There’s so much to do in these areas it’s just too fun! That area between 68 and 70 is my favorite. [Travis Williams],tbd,tbd

Building on the proprietary combat system, two players will be able to team up (online) with the USB headset and defeat enemies together or play alone using an AI (artificial intelligence) controlled character for a unique cooperative gameplay experience. If playing alone, the second character is controlled by artificial intelligence and a cunning player will observe their actions to learn how to best approach the fighting scenarios when replaying the area as the opposite character. Rau has four weapons in his arsenal: battle axe, Taiaha (spear), broadsword and bow and arrow that now acts as a stealth weapon. Tati has twin daggers, a deadly staff with retracting blades, an axe, a proximity-based weapon and the ability to become invisible in stealth mode. Each character has his/her special skills that can be developed along the way. While Rau is able to use Kuzo the bird to scout unknown territory, distract enemies and retrieve items, Tati can ""spirit walk"" and see through the eyes of the dead. Tati also has the ability to blend seamlessly into the environment and wait undetected, furthering the strategic element of the gameplay. Satisfaction of ending a level is now by way of defeating a boss. Three imposing bosses will make full use of the ""Mark of Kri"" cinematic approach. [SCEA]",68,6.7

Well don't be fooled by its simplicity just yet as there is more to this game than meets the eye.

RobotRescueRevolution_Screen2

The twist in this game of strategy and logic is that each and every robot shares linked controls. This means that you can't move each robot individually, rather each and every move you make will cause all the robots to move simultaneously in the same direction- and here is where the fun begins!

Besides cracking the puzzles on your own there is also the option to play with a friend in Two-Player mode which is broken down into co-op and split screen modes. In Co-op mode you and a buddy can play on the same screen and work together to crack the puzzles, bringing the robots back to safety. Or if you're feeling a little competitive you can challenge a friend in Duel mode where you will battle it out on identical but separate maps seeing who solves the puzzle and makes it to the finish line first.

Robot Rescue Revolution also lets you take a backseat to all the brain-bending puzzles by giving you a chance to be the mastermind behind your own maps. With Map Editor you can design your own maps and upload them online, sharing them with the rest of the Robot Rescue community. Oh! And don't forget about earning all the Robot Rescue Revolution trophies for your PlayStation Trophy Cabinet!",tbd,tbd

Tom Clancy's HAWX,PlayStation 3,"March 3, 2009","Tom Clancy's HAWX (high-altitude warfare) promises to revolutionize the way players think about combat in the sky. The story begins in the year 2012. As the era of the nation-state draws quickly to a close, the rules of warfare evolve even more rapidly. More and more nations become increasingly dependent on private military companies (PMCs), elite mercenaries with a lax view of the law. The Reykjavik Accords further legitimize their existence by authorizing their right to serve in every aspect of military operations. While the benefits of such PMCs are apparent, growing concerns surrounding giving them too much power begin to mount. The Enhanced Reality System is the backbone of the HAWX flight experience: radars and incoming missile detection, anti-crash system, damage control system, tactical map and information relay, and weapons trajectory control. E.R.S. also allows players to issue orders to their squadron, making this system as iconic to HAWX as the Cross-Com system is to Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter. Players can ease into their flight missions and gain a level of comfort with the use of the assistance mode. Once employed, players can take full advantage of their technological support through the E.R.S and gain maximum piloting security. If the situation calls for the player to unleash the full potential of the aircraft, the assistance mode can be switched off and all safety features will be deactivated.

To get the game right, EA once again turned to the pros--American League MVP Jason Giambi of the Oakland A's and National League Manager of the Year Dusty Baker of the S.F. Giants lent their expertise on how to play hardball in the majors. Of course, in baseball, what it all boils down to is the showdown at the plate--the pitcher facing off against the batter for all the money. Triple Play Baseball again refines the game with a power zone/contact zone batting cursor--power hitters may have a tiny cursor, but it's all power zone, while more dependable sluggers will have a larger cursor but may have a smaller sweet spot. Batters are going to need all that control if they're hoping to tee off the pitching this year, which is also improved in control to give them every trick in the books. Players' skills are accurately based on player stats from last season, so if you see Mark McGwire at the plate or Randy Johnson on the mound, expect some bad things to go down.",74,tbd

Wild ARMs 5,PlayStation 2,"August 28, 2007","WILD ARMS 5 follows the journey of a group of young travelers as they try to unlock the mysteries of their ravaged land and unknowingly become involved in a struggle that will decide the fate of the entire world. 12,000 years ago, the world of Filgaia was a land immersed in technology far beyond anything found in the present day. For reasons unknown, however, the citizens of this advanced culture suddenly abandoned their technology, leaving the future of the human race to live in a comparatively primitive state. All that remained of this once great civilization were some scattered mechanical parts and the occasional remnants of a legendary golem -- huge mechanical devices built to serve mankind. While use of the old technology remained mostly out of reach, there were some who had begun to research the ancient devices, seeking even the faintest hope of enriching their lives on this desolate world. The situation changed dramatically about a hundred years ago when a new race known as the Veruni arrived on the planet. Although similar in appearance to humans, the Veruni's superior physical attributes and advanced technology allowed them to quickly establish dominance over mankind. The human race found itself relegated to second-class status, and many citizens were forced to perform hard labor day in and day out in order to survive. Fast-forward to the present day. In a small town called Capo Bronco on the outskirts of Filgaia, two youths, Dean Stark and Rebecca Streisand, witness an unbelievable event -- the giant arm of a golem somehow falling from the sky. Their disbelief grows further when they discover that within the clenched fist of the golem's hand lies a girl with little recollection of her past other than her name -- ""Avril."" This chance encounter inspires Dean and Rebecca to travel with Avril across the wastelands of Filgaia in hopes of helping her regain her lost memories. Little do they know their journey will eventually decide the fate of all mankind. [XSEED]",71,7.8
