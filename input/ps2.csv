And UbiSoft's delightfully surreal game is just that, a wonderfully entertaining slice of ball-flipping action that anyone can enjoy. The first thing you'll notice when you get your mitts on Flipnic is just how huge the 'tables' are. Based on five different themes, including Jungle, Techno and Metal, these unique worlds contain stunning landscapes, complete with their own individual wildlife, flora and fauna. The first set of tables has a lush tropical look, with butterflies floating over the game as you frantically bash buttons in an attempt to achieve Flipnic's surreal objectives. The challenges include saving pink flamingos from the jaws of hungry crocodiles, destroying UFOs, and feeding hungry monkeys by knocking bananas into their waiting paws. And when you're not putting your mean pinballing skills to the test in single-player mode, you can also throw down the gauntlet to friends in multiplayer modes, with Pinball Soccer and Pinball Basketball available for two-player action. Possibly the most surreal addition to the genre, Flipnic sports beautifully vibrant graphics, intuitive controls, and some of the best ball physics you'll ever encounter in a pinball sim.

In the Groove 2,PlayStation 2,"June 17, 2005","While Red OctaneÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½s IN THE GROOVE will remind players of KonamiÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½s DANCE DANCE REVOLUTION, the game kicks up the difficulty a notch in several ways, the most prominent of which is requiring three or four arrows to be hit at once. This means players will have to not only jump around but drop to the floor to slap arrows with their hands. Another major difference between IN THE GROOVE and DDR is the arrows. Here, they are fully polygonal, meaning the arrows can spin around, bounce up and down, look like theyÃ¢ï¿½ï¿½re vanishing into the background, and other tricks that challenge the player. Another addition is the mine arrow. Stepping or slapping one of these will cause the arrow to explode and break the combo chain the player was building up. Fortunately, the game includes a large variety of difficulty settings (13 different difficulty levels in all), so even beginners can get into the dancing action. The game play modes include all of the standard ones gamers have come to expect in a dancing game: arcade mode, two-player challenge mode, workout mode, and never-ending modes are all available for players to enjoy. The song list is fairly large as well with over 70 titles.

The DUALSHOCK 2 controller's analog features are now a key element of the batting, pitching, and fielding control for a truer sports gaming experience. To get the game right, EA once again turned to the pros--American League MVP Jason Giambi of the Oakland A's and National League Manager of the Year Dusty Baker of the S.F. Giants lent their expertise on how to play hardball in the majors. Of course, in baseball, what it all boils down to is the showdown at the plate--the pitcher facing off against the batter for all the money. Triple Play Baseball again refines the game with a power zone/contact zone batting cursor--power hitters may have a tiny cursor, but it's all power zone, while more dependable sluggers will have a larger cursor but may have a smaller sweet spot. Batters are going to need all that control if they're hoping to tee off the pitching this year, which is also improved in control to give them every trick in the books.

For reasons unknown, however, the citizens of this advanced culture suddenly abandoned their technology, leaving the future of the human race to live in a comparatively primitive state. All that remained of this once great civilization were some scattered mechanical parts and the occasional remnants of a legendary golem -- huge mechanical devices built to serve mankind. While use of the old technology remained mostly out of reach, there were some who had begun to research the ancient devices, seeking even the faintest hope of enriching their lives on this desolate world. The situation changed dramatically about a hundred years ago when a new race known as the Veruni arrived on the planet. Although similar in appearance to humans, the Veruni's superior physical attributes and advanced technology allowed them to quickly establish dominance over mankind. The human race found itself relegated to second-class status, and many citizens were forced to perform hard labor day in and day out in order to survive. Fast-forward to the present day. In a small town called Capo Bronco on the outskirts of Filgaia, two youths, Dean Stark and Rebecca Streisand, witness an unbelievable event -- the giant arm of a golem somehow falling from the sky. Their disbelief grows further when they discover that within the clenched fist of the golem's hand lies a girl with little recollection of her past other than her name -- ""Avril.""
