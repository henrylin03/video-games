Over time, all of these worlds become wastelands abundant with landfills and continents of trash.After many years of this repeating pattern, the human race slowly realized that space itself is the largest void they have access to, and can easily be used as their collective ""landfill.""Then, after hundreds of years of planets jettisoning their trash off into their galaxy, it finally started to catch up to them. Space trash, also referred to by many as ""brogguts"", started to gather and form giant masses, some even the size of planets.One extremely bright human spends his life dedicated to solving this problem of dirty space. He eventually comes up with a low power process that can convert 99% of this trash back into usable energy. He also discovers a way to refine brogguts into an incredible sturdy metal, which can be used to create advanced space craft and structures.Brogguts have become the currency of the galaxy, and where there is any form of currency, there is war and piracy. Space pirates, battling corporations, even government conspiracies are all the driving factors in the current state of the human race.---- About ----Brogguts is a RTS (Real Time Strategy) game developed by Foster Lockwood under the supervision of Ming Chow at Tufts University.The goal was to create, from scratch, a fully functional RTS engine for the iPad and demonstrate various elements of gameplay on top of that engine.

Dead by Daylight: Shattered Bloodline,Xbox One,"September 18, 2018","What lies beneath the mundane can be terrifying. Under the layers of quaint family life, violence festers. When this dark rampant force lashes out, lives are broken and families shattered. Wrath was her bloodline. She came home to find unimaginable horrors, which left their mark. Now she walks, haunting and vengeful, between this world and the next. Adam Francis has no legacy, no inheritance. Everything he owns, he had to earn. Disciplined and driven, he knows he can do anything when he puts his mind to it. His hard work paid off when he found a job miles away from home. Now living in Japan, he shares the hard lessons he had to learn on his own.

NEW KILLER: THE SPIRIT
She inherited incredible fury from her ancestors. The wrath that flows through her veins is her legacy. The terrible pain she suffered set it off. Swift and lethal, The Spirit exacts her revenge endlessly. The Spirit is a phase-walking Killer able to catch Survivors off-guard with her traversal power, Yamaoka's Haunting. 

Killer Power - The Spirit: Yamaoka's Haunting
Yamoka is the name she carries from her ancestors, who unleashed hell on the battlefield. The Spirit draws her power from their wrath, haunting the living as retribution for her suffering. The Spirit can use her power, Yamaoka's Haunting, to enter an ethereal plane and phase-walk to a new location, unseen by human eyes.
While Yamaoka's Haunting is active:

-The Spirit may traverse freely to a new location, moving at a faster rate for a short duration. She is still confined to movement within the physical environments and surroundings.

-The Spirit leaves the physical plane, losing sight of all Survivors. She can, however, still sense the scratch marks they leave in the environment.

-The Spirit will produce an audible cue at her current location. Once the power has ended, The Spirit retains her speed boost for a brief period and her husk fades away.
Using Yamaoka's Haunting depletes The Spirit's power bar. The power bar will automatically replenish over time. The power bar must be fully replenished before it can be triggered again.
 
KILLER PERKS

The Spirit comes with 3 new perks. 

Spirit Fury
Every time a pallet is broken, the fury of The Entity builds within. After breaking 4/3/2 pallets, the next dropped pallet you interact with will be instantly broken by the Entity. 

Hex: Haunted Ground

Rancor
Obsession Perk when a Generator is completed. The Obsession location is revealed to you for 3 seconds and the Obsession sees your aura for 5/4/3 seconds. When the Obsession is dead, all Survivors location are revealed to you for 3 seconds each time a Generator is completed. 

NEW SURVIVOR: ADAM FRANCIS 

The Inspiring Teacher
Born and raised in Kingston, Jamaica, Adam is a resourceful teacher whose expectations of himself and others are higher than most. He is a driven autodidact who always strives to improve himself. Finding opportunity miles away from his island, he built a new home from scratch. In Japan, he was seen as a hard teacher with a good heart. While he was tough during class, he held study sessions every day after school and spent hours answering any student's questions. His kind nature allows him to adapt easily and resolve difficult situations. Adam's personal perks help him to distract The Killer, survive desperate situations, and become more skilled as the trial continues.

SURVIVOR PERKS

Adam Francis comes with 3 new perks. 

Diversion
Activatable Perk. Standing within the Killer Terror Radius while not in a chase for 45 seconds activates the perk. Once the perk is activated, press the Active Ability button while crouched and motionless to throw a pebble, which creates a loud noise notification for The Killer at a distance of 10/15/20 Meters. The perk deactivates once it has been used. ""There's what is easy and then there's what is right. If you confuse the two, there's no telling what you become."" Adam Francis 

Deliverance
After performing a safe hook rescue on another Survivor, the perk activates. You now have a 100% chance to unhook yourself during the escape attempt. A successful Deliverance from the hook triggers the Broken status effect for 100/80/60 seconds. ""I was raised by a strict man who taught me how to make the best of a bad situation."" Adam Francis 

Autodidact
You start the trial with a -25% progression penalty for Skill Checks to heal Survivors. For every successful Skill Check completed while healing a Survivor, you receive a Token for a maximum of 3/4/5 Tokens. Each Token grants you a +15% bonus progression for a successful Skill Check while healing Survivors. Great Skill Checks cannot be performed while using Autodidact. Autodidact is not active when using a Med Kit to heal.""There's no limit to what you can achieve, as long as you back it up with hard work."" Adam Francis

NEW MAP: THE YAMAOKA ESTATE -- FAMILY RESIDENCE

The estate was bought by the first of the Yamaoka, a shipwreck survivor, who came from a distant ashy island. He washed ashore just as political tensions sparked the flames of war. Yamaoka joined the battlefield and unleashed hell on his foes. No one could match the raw fury of his katana, which elevated him to a legend. They say his devilish mask haunted the dreams of all men. His fame grew as he spilled blood on both sides of the conflict. With power came wealth, which he used to buy the estate and begin his legacy. The land was passed down from one generation to the next, each one leaving its mark on the landscape. The garden grew and expended through the ages. Now only an old maple tree remains untouched from Yamaoka's era, representing the whole family.

While the Yamaoka estate displayed a glorious past, the family residence was falling apart. The house needed numerous renovations to remain habitable. The last generation of the Yamaoka family were facing troubled times. Their finances were dire and the situation worsened when the daughter started university, just a few months before the mother became ill. Shouldering both university fees and hospital bills, the father worked past exhaustion. To keep a roof over their heads, he profaned their legacy. The walls of their ancestral home were sealed with moldy materials for a cheap fix. As the house was stripped of its integrity, an old anger was awakened.",tbd,tbd

The city's ultramodern architecture lies half-buried under millions of tons of sand. The very sand that blankets the city plays a marquee role in altering combat situations and serves as a powerful but unpredictable force that will both help and hinder players throughout the course of the game. While most people have fled the now-barren wasteland before the sandstorms swept through, U.S. Army Colonel John Konrad and his loyal squad remained behind to protect those incapable of escape. Unable to reach anyone in Dubai after the storm hit, the U.S. Army feared Konrad and his team dead until they picked up a weak distress signal and launched a rescue operation. As U.S. Army Captain Martin Walker, you and your elite Delta Force team are sent to infiltrate the treacherous region to bring Konrad home.

First there was the Exodus when survivors of a great war left the ruins of the Galactic Core behind in search of a new home in the stars. Scattered worlds were claimed on the fringe of the galaxy. Each pocket of survivors held on to an isolated set of worlds while trying to rebuild under the great law of Shalun. Three centuries later, technology has brought them back together again. Discovery of the hyperwarp has bridged what was once an unimaginable distance between far-flung colonies, long-lost families, and political factions. 

With that reunification has come great economic prosperity. The hyperwarp reestablished the transportation of cargo, goods, and technologies between the quadrants but it has also brought great strife. Political rivalries have been rekindled, blood has been shed in age-old feuds, and the fires of war have been stoked. Amidst the political infighting, a ruthless revolution is rising and the fervent explorers of the hyperwarp have awoken something that was better left asleep.

Our very first game, Star Traders RPG, took hundreds of thousands of gamers on an interstellar adventure. Star Traders' success and overwhelmingly positive reception helped to launch Trese Brothers Games. It was the adventures of our community's star-crossed captains that put us on a trajectory to share more of our worlds, ideas, and dreams.

We set out to capture the loneliness, bravery, and camaraderie of people living together in a spaceship sailing across the stars. It is with great pride that after releasing four other games in the Star Traders universe, we've created a sequel to the original Star Traders RPG.

Through the Darkest of Times,Xbox One,"August 13, 2020","Dark times mean fear and risks. The risk to be caught by patrolling National Socialists, looking for people who publicly stand against their point of view. The risk of being beaten up or even killed by the German military because we're opposing the regime. The risk of losing everything, including our loved ones. This is how we live. This is how we try to survive. Through the darkest of times.

You are the leader of a small resistance group in 1933's Berlin, of ordinary people, from Jews to Catholics and Communists to Patriots who simply can't stand aside. Your goal is to deal with small blows to the regime dropping leaflets to spread awareness about what the Nazis are really up to among the people, painting messages on walls, sabotaging, gathering information and recruiting more followers. And all of that while staying undercover if the regime's forces learn about your group, the life of each member is in grave danger.

Through the Darkest of Times is a historical resistance strategy game, focusing on conveying the somber mood of the period and the very real struggles of average people living in the 3rd Reich.
